## Time-Varying Impact of the WASDE Report on Corn Futures Prices

This repository contains codes for the paper. The article deduced that when the USDA production estimate is 1% higher than the average private analysts' estimate, futures price goes down by 1% using Linear Regression. Kalman filtering, a Bayesian state-space model, confirmed the existence of time-varying impact of the WASDE report on corn futures prices. Several prediction models tried as well. Please find below the citation and the codes details. Thanks!
